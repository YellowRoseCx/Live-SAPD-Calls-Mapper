# Live-SAPD-Calls-Mapper

Live-SAPD-Calls-Mapper is a real-time data handling and mapping application for the San Antonio Police Department’s Calls for Service. The program fetches live data of public safety calls, maps the calls based on their location, and provides an interface to interact with the data. The data represents each instance when someone called the police for service, providing a quick way to find information regarding public safety calls in your neighborhood or area. It’s a valuable tool for identifying patterns of 9-1-1 call types happening throughout the City of San Antonio. The information for the reports and map is derived directly from the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system.
